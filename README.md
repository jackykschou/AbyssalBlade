#Always keep in mind:
##1. For programmers, never push to master or develop directly. Instead, do stuffs in your own branch and then create a pull request to merge to develop.
##2. For programmers, most of the time you want to have your peer to review your pull request and merge it. (Unless you have high confidence that your changes won't break anything)
##3. Never put any file larger than 100MB in your repo. If you must do that, talk to the team.
##4. Before pushing to the repo, please make sure that the project builds.
##5. DO NOT update the version of Unity unless the whole team commit to do so.
##6. For artists, before you what to update any art asset file, make sure to check the [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10iP3r4hvf417LOF_5v7b9rWxn5eXMq64Qgx2zFevNog/edit#gid=0) to make sure that NO ONE has checked out the file. Contact to the checked out person if necessary.
##7. If you have any conflicts during a merge/push/pull and you are not sure how to solve it. DO NOT force the merge and please ask for help.
##8. When building the game out with Unity, always build to the Builds folder (or outside of the repo) to prevent the game binary files to be living in the repo.
